# Thesis-stuff
A repo for the stuff I did to complete my master thesis to display my work, and to use as reference for the Tennessee Eastman project

The basis of this project was to extract an expert machine operator's knowledge, fuse it with a data-driven fault detection approach,
and then use it to help train new operators on clearing faults on the machine by automating the fault detection, and providing a
troubleshooting strategy to follow (from a rule based derived from the expert operator's knowledge).

The Tennessee Eastman file was an attempt to make a meaningful comparison between XGBoost and RandomForest as justification for going with
XGB for fault detection, because the dataset from the machine was very sparse in nature and did not pose much of a "challenge" to any
supervised method, eg. XGB, RandomForest, SVM, etc. Thus, I took on Tennessee Eastman as a way to avoid it looking as though I said,
"Just XGBoost it, that's what everyone else on Kaggle does."
