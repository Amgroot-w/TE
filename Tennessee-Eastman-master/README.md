# Tennessee-Eastman

I learned a great deal while tackling the Tennessee Eastman problem as an appendix to my Thesis. 
I'm going to tackle it as a main feature here as a personal project, using both supervised and unsupervised approaches.

This will be a "living" project so I will commit new pieces to the script as I write them and solve the issues I have. 
TX_XGB.py in the Thesis repo will be of particular interest to contrast how I solve approach the problem this round as opposed
to the week I spent working on it before.
